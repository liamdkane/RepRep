This was built as a redesign of an app I worked on as a part of a Hackathon team.

Originally I did not do any of the design for the app, so I took on the challenge of remaking it into a more modern design. 
Special thanks to [Marty Avedon](https://github.com/martyav) for making the logo, political party icons, and colours used in the app.
